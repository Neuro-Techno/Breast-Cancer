# Breast-Cancer
Breast cancer diagnosis using U-NET neural network: This network uses deep learning and convolutional networks to detect specific regions of interest from
breast pathological images.

"Input-Train" and "Mask-Train" are just samples of my training images, and you can provide your own relevant images. Please provide your images as input 
and their corresponding masks as the training labels. With this approach, the U-NET neural network will be able to learn and detect the desired patterns 
in your images."
